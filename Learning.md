#Things I learned so far in **Markdown**:
* It is a very easy way to style text on Github, we use it here instead of HTML because it is a fast and effortless way to take notes about your projects and share it with others, it also uses a .md extension.

##There are also many things that you can do, for example:
* When You want your text to be **Bald** You Use ** ** or _ _
* If you want it to be *italic* you use * * or - -
* you can also insert images by wrapping link text in brackets ![ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ), ![Like this](https://attaa.sa/files/library_thumbnails/c8c83ba_1600208181.jpg)
* And you can also quote someone by using > like this:
Your success and happiness lie in you
